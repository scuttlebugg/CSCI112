## This is My Play Space

I haven't used GitHub pages before, so be patient.

Markdown is new to me too. lol. Moar patience, please!

### This is my to-do list...
1. Get familiar with GitHub; contribute a few times a week.
2. Fix my personal website; I swear I have a personal website. Need to actually get it moving along. 
3. Find a kick-ass project to contribute to; maybe something game related?
